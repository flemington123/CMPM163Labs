BottomLeft: This is one is followed the tutorial. Basic material and color with Three.js.

BottomRight: My own Three.js one. I try to look some special material on the example site.

TopLeft: Also the tutorial one with renderer. Basic material and color.

TopRight: My own renderer cube. In the fragment shader, I changed the color from two to three. By modifying the code, I made them work.

Questions:
1. x = 8u while u = x/8.
2. y = 8 - 8v.
3. As I conut by previous two formula, (0.375, 0.25) is white.

From left to the right:

Cube 1: Created by following the tutorial. Two texture (151.jpg and 155_norm.jpg) mix together and create this detail cube.

Cube 2: Also created by tutorail. Using the one of the same texture (151.jpg) with the cube 1, but it lacks another texture.

Cube 3: My own mix cube which created by three.js. The two texture are 154.jpg and 156_norm.jpg.

Cube 4: Created by tutorial and renderer. Using the normal renderer setting and 152.jpg as texture.

Cube 5: My own renderer 4x4 cube. Using only one texture 172.jpg and changing the fragmentShader setting to make the texture display mulptiple times by changing the vUv.
