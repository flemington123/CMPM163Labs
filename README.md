BottomLeft: This is one is followed the tutorial. Basic material and color with Three.js.

BottomRight: My own Three.js one. I try to look some special material on the example site.

TopLeft: Also the tutorial one with renderer. Basic material and color.

TopRight: My own renderer cube. In the fragment shader, I changed the color from two to three. By modifying the code, I made them work.
